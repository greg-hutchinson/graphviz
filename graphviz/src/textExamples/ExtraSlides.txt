The Java Api
Grappa -
- Very low level API - Almost no extra layer of abstraction
- Lots of code dedicated to rendering.

Dot - Bitbucket - URl goes here.
- Very nice abstractions
-- Graph, Node, Edge, Subgraph
-- DefaultGraphAttribute, DefaultNodeAttributes, DefaultEdgeAttributes
-- All creation of other objects is supplied from an instance of Graph,
--- (i.e. newNode("NodeName"), newEdge(node1, node2), newDefaultNodeAttributes, etc.

Example using the Java Binding - Use this terminology everywhere else - binding
- Use HtmlLabel
-

In Wikis and Sharepoint
- What is the problem with diagrams in Wikis?
-- Where is the source for the diagram?
-- What changed from one version to the other?
- Graphviz is source

Feature Branches within Hg
- Automerge
